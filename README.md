# Peanutbutter (Vanilla+) [StationAPI]

Get it, 'cuz it's a vanilla+ mod and it's called peanutbutter, which you add to vanilla icecream? I thought it was witty.

## Core Beliefs
- good food should be made from bad food/non-food
- wood and stone tools shouldn't be abandoned in ten seconds because iron is so easy to get
  - I didn't like how in the first 5 minutes of the game, you could immediately jump right from wood to stone to iron
    tools without even going underground.

## Implemented
- Copper
  - Replaces stone
  - Iron spawns lower (no longer at the surface)
  - Slows down early game progression
- Hematite
  - red ingot
  - found in the nether
  - sidegrade (not upgrade) from diamond, better for combat since nether is combat-focused
- New decoration blocks
  - Stone bricks
  - Carved bone
  - Copper block
- New crops/food
  - Tomato + tomato seeds + tomato crop
  - Curry (TODO craft with 1 cooked pork, 1 tomato, 1 bowl)
- New structures
  - Overworld
    - Pyramids (plains and desert)
    - Ruins (procedural!)
  - Nether
    - Pyramid
- New mobs
  - Cockatrice
  - Swamp Monster

### Planned? (Literally all my ideas good or bad)
- Hematite lance
  - hi dmg + reach
  - hematite top right, two sticks diagonal, and two golden feathers by the hematite
- Hematite hammer
  - hi dmg + knockback
- new music disc(s)
- maracas
- baubles
  - bauble shards, which you need 9 of to craft a bauble
  - bauble slots (like 4 or something?)
  - Chest bauble (increases your inventory space by 9)
  - Jump bauble (gives you an extra air jump)
- new enemies
  - stone golem
  - goblin
- uncraftable weapons and armor
  - found in structures
  - throwable dynamite
- boss called the "Undead Queen," (summoned by placing a nether crown from a structure on top of a T of gold)
  - gives a use to gold
  - drops a rare/useful item
  - idk where the nether crown will be found
- "ghast nursery" structure that spawns baby ghasts
- overworld structure (underground, like strongholds) made of blocks (called "???") that require hematite to be able to break into, so there's no way to go into them until after you reach the nether
- add new achievements
  - "Doom the nether" / defeat the nether queen
  - "This is my jam" / collect all the music discs
