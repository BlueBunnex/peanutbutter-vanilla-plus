# Peanutbutter (Vanilla+) [StationAPI]

Get it, 'cuz it's a vanilla+ mod and it's called peanutbutter, which you add to vanilla icecream? I thought it was witty.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod **will** be made by doing runs in survival and deducing from that what would be fun to add.

### Literally all my ideas (good or bad)
- new music disc(s)
- new crops
- hematite
  - red ingot
  - found in the nether
  - better than diamond
- new structures
- new enemies
  - stone golem
  - goblin
- new decoration blocks
- uncraftable weapons and armor
  - found in structures
  - throwable dynamite
- boss called the "Undead Queen," (summoned by placing a nether crown from a structure on top of a T of gold)
  - gives a use to gold
  - drops a rare/useful item
  - idk where the nether crown will be found
- "ghast nursery" structure that spawns baby ghasts
- overworld structure (underground, like strongholds) made of blocks (called "???") that require hematite to be able to break into, so there's no way to go into them until after you reach the nether
- add new achievements
  - "Doom the nether" / beat the nether queen
  - "This is my jam" / collect all the music discs
