# Peanutbutter (Vanilla+) [StationAPI]

Get it, 'cuz it's a vanilla+ mod and it's called peanutbutter, which you add to vanilla icecream? I thought it was witty.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod **will** be made by doing runs in survival and deducing from that what would be fun to add.

- hematite
  - red ingot
  - found in the nether
  - better than diamond
- new structures
- new enemies
  - stone golem
  - goblin
- new decoration blocks
- uncraftable weapons and armor
  - found in structures
  - throwable dynamite
- boss called the "Undead Queen," (summoned by placing a nether crown from a structure on top of a T of gold)
  - gives a use to gold
  - drops a rare/useful item
- "ghast nursery" structure that spawns baby ghasts
